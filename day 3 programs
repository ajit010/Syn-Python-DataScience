   Classes and Objects ::
  
  1. Create a class called `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`. Include methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

Solution :

# Rectangle Class

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)

# Example usage
rect = Rectangle(10, 5)
print("Area:", rect.area())
print("Perimeter:", rect.perimeter())

2. Create a class called `Employee` with attributes `name`, `age`, and `salary`. Include a method to display the details of the employee.

3. Create a class called `Car` with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. Include a method to display the details of the car.

4. Create a class called `Circle` with attribute `radius`. Include methods to calculate the area and circumference of the circle.

5. Create a class called `Student` with attributes `name`, `age`, and `grade`. Include a method to display the details of the student.
