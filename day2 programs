1. Write a program to use all arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, Divison, Modulus and exponent

2. Write a program for comparison, logical and assignments operators ---

3. Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero

4. Check if a no. is even or odd

5. Write a program using "if-else" "if-elseif-else" and nested-if statements 

  -- consider three different scenarios ..
 
 
6. Write a program to predict a leap year or not ...

7. Find the Largest Number Among Three Numbers 

8. Develop a program that calculates the factorial of a number using a while loop.

9. Find the type of Triangle (Isosceles, Equilateral or Scalene)

10. Convert a percantage (numeric) grade to letter grade

11. Write a program to print all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a for loop.

12. Write a program to print the reverse of a given number using a while loop.

13.  Write a program to find the sum of all digits in a given number using a while loop. ---

14. Develop a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string using a for loop and continue statement.

15. Write a program to skip Even Numbers and Print Numbers Until 10

16. Create a program to print all numbers between 1 and 100 that are not divisible by 2 or 3 using a for loop and continue statement.


  Part 2 -- Functions and Modules  ::


1. Create a 'greet' function in Python

>> Solution :
    
 # Create a function in Python

def greet():
    print("Hello from a function!")

greet()


# Simple Example with an Argument:


def greet(name):         # ← 'name' is a parameter
    print("Hello", name)

greet("Aditya")          # ← "Aditya" is the argument


2. Create a function with variable length of arguments

>> Solution :

# Function with Variable-Length Arguments

def print_names(*names):
    for name in names:
        print(name)

print_names("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")


3. Return multiple values from a function 

>> Solution :
    
    # Return Multiple Values from a Function

def calculate(a, b):
    return a + b, a * b

add, multiply = calculate(5, 3)
print("Sum:", add)
print("Product:", multiply)



4. Create a function with a default argument

>> Solution :
    
    # Function with Default Argument

def greet(name="Guest"):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet()
greet("Aditya")



5. Create a Recursive Function :

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print("Factorial:", factorial(5))


6. Assign a Different Name to a Function and Call It

def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

new_greet = say_hello
new_greet()






Task 1: Mini Calculator (Menu-Driven)

Topics Covered:

Functions (with default & variable arguments)

Conditional statements

Arithmetic operators

Loops (optional for repeated usage)

Description:
Build a calculator with options for:

1. Addition

2. Subtraction

3. Multiplication

4. Division

5. Exponent

6. Modulus

(Keep the 7th option as Exit)

Let the user choose an operation from a menu and input two numbers.

Goal: Allow repeated calculations until the user exits.


Guide to Create  :

1. You can create 6-7 functions for each arithmetic operation ..

2. Use while Loop to print out menu Options

3. Utilise if else options to provide resulted operation based on choice ...





Task 2:  ATM Simulation (Menu-Driven)

Features:

Login with PIN

Withdraw, deposit, check balance

Simple authentication



Concepts Used:

While loops

Conditions

Functions with parameters

Simple state management


  




  


17. Create a program to print prime numbers for a given range.
